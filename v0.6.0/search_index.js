Therefore, when choosing the value of parameter varepsilon, a compromise is needed. In practice, it is necessary to choose such value of the varepsilon that condition number of Gram matrix is small enough. Numerical procedures of the matrix condition number estimation are well known.","category":"page"},{"location":"Normal-Splines-Method/","page":"Normal Splines Method","title":"Normal Splines Method","text":"As well, it is useful to preprocess the source data of the problem by transforming the domain where interpolation nodes are located into the unit hypercube.","category":"page"},{"location":"Normal-Splines-Method/","page":"Normal Splines Method","title":"Normal Splines Method","text":"The normal splines method for one-dimensional function interpolation and linear ordinary differential and integral equations was proposed in [8] and [9] and developed in [10]. An idea of the multivariate splines in Sobolev space was initially formulated in [25], however it was not well-suited to solving real-world problems. Using that idea the multivariate generalization of the normal splines method was developed for two-dimensional problem of low-range computerized tomography in [15] and applied for solving a mathematical economics problem in [11]. At the same time an interpolation scheme with Matérn kernels was developed in [26], this scheme coincides with interpolating normal splines method. Further results related to  applications of the normal splines method were reported at the seminars and conferences [14,21,22].

Infinite dimensionality of the space H for this algorithm is irrelevant. The most computationally costly part of the algorithm is calculation of projection vartheta^k by solving system (10). Matrices of all systems (10) are positive definite because of linear independence of elements h_i, and it is convenient to use Cholesky decomposition to factorize them . At every step of the algorithm a constraint is added to or removed from the current active set and the system (10) matrix gets modified by the corresponding row and symmetric column addition or deletion.
