Infinite dimensionality of the space H for this algorithm is irrelevant. The most computationally costly part of the algorithm is calculation of projection vartheta^k by solving system (10). Matrices of all systems (10) are positive definite because of linear independence of elements h_i, and it is convenient to use Cholesky decomposition to factorize them . At every step of the algorithm a constraint is added to or removed from the current active set and the system (10) matrix gets modified by the corresponding row and symmetric column addition or deletion.

Usually the heuristic procedure produces an estimation of the scaling ('shape') parameter varepsilon that is good enough for getting accurate interpolation results. As it could be expected interpolants built with RK_H1 and RK_H2 kernels produce better approximation for a smooth function. In some cases a normal spline constructed with RK_H2 kernel may demonstrate higher oscillations and interpolation artifacts. It is especially true when reconstructed surface is not smooth and exhibits significant variations (see results of reconstructing of the Franke and Nielson 'faults and creases' model, where one can notice wavy behavior near the fault and 'edge effects' near the surface front edge). Thereby, if we do not have any specific reason to choose another kernel, the normal spline constructed with RK_H1 kernel can be a best choice.","category":"page"},{"location":"Numerical-Tests/","page":"Numerical Tests","title":"Numerical Tests","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"Numerical-Tests/","page":"Numerical Tests","title":"Numerical Tests","text":"References","category":"page"},{"location":"Numerical-Tests/","page":"Numerical Tests","title":"Numerical Tests","text":"[1] R.
